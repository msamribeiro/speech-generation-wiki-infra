# Q1 2026 Ingest Session

**Date:** 2026-08-02
**Goal:** Ingest all accepted Q1 2026 (January–March 2026) papers into the wiki.

Bootstrapped from `docs/records/2026-08-02-q4-2025-ingestion-sessions.md`, which holds the full
paper-by-paper Q4 2025 log (8 sessions, 180 papers, complete). This file carries forward the
ingestion protocol and cadence preferences refined during Q3/Q4, without the historical narrative.

---

## Scope

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Already ingested (Q1 2026) | 7 |
| Remaining to ingest | 159 |
| Rejected | 58 |
| **Total Q1 2026 in corpus** | **224** |

As of 2026-08-02 (bootstrap, session not yet started). Fetch and filter are fully complete for
this quarter. Counts computed from `raw/metadata/*.json` where `year == 2026` and
`month in (1, 2, 3)` (these fields are derived from `published_date`, not the arXiv ID prefix —
see the ID-prefix note below). Re-run before starting a session, as fetch/filter may still be
adding papers:

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 -c "
import json, glob
accepted, ingested, rejected = 0, 0, 0
for path in glob.glob('raw/metadata/*.json'):
    m = json.load(open(path))
    y, mo = str(m.get('year','')), str(m.get('month','0')).zfill(2)
    if y == '2026' and mo in ('01','02','03'):
        if m['status'] == 'accepted': accepted += 1
        if m['status'] == 'ingested': ingested += 1
        if m['status'] == 'rejected': rejected += 1
print(f'Ingested: {ingested} | Remaining: {accepted} | Rejected: {rejected}')
"
```

## Next Session — Resume Here

No sessions have run yet. To start, re-run the progress-count script above to confirm the current
counts, then build a fresh candidate list chronologically by `published_date` (not by arXiv ID
prefix — see the note below) starting from the earliest remaining Q1 2026 `accepted` paper. Follow
the ingest cadence and quality-check procedure below.

---

## Success Criteria

- All accepted Q1 2026 papers have `status: ingested` in `raw/metadata/`
- Health check passes corpus-wide with zero errors:
  ```bash
  .venv/bin/python scripts/health_check.py --module ingest --wiki-dir /Users/sribeiro/Documents/Coding/speech-generation-wiki/speech-generation-wiki-content
  ```

---

## Methodology

### Claims format

```markdown
## Claims

- **supports:** {Generalized, field-level claim sentence — no paper/model names or raw metrics.}
  > *Evidence:* {Specific result, mechanism, comparison, dataset, or ablation.} *(§N.N, Table N)*
- **complicates:** {Generalized claim sentence.}
  > *Evidence:* {Specific limitation, failure case, or trade-off.} *(§N.N)*
```

Role prefix is one of `supports:`, `complicates:`, `contradicts:`, `refines:`, bolded. The
`Evidence:` line is an italic-led blockquote with paper-local detail and a section citation.
Named-section citations need the `§` prefix even for non-numbered sections (e.g. `*(§Limitations)*`).

### Ingest cadence

Default (as run throughout Q3/Q4): pre-select the full remaining list chronologically up front,
then work through it in batches of 4. Within each batch:

1. One paper at a time — no parallel ingest workers.
2. Run the per-paper health check after each paper; fix bare wikilinks and any schema errors
   before moving to the next paper.
3. After all 4 papers in the batch are clean, write a short batch summary (paper IDs, notable
   QC catches, corpus page count, updated Q1 progress numbers) and append it to this file's
   Session Log.
4. Wait for an explicit go-ahead before starting the next batch.

The user may drop to one-paper-at-a-time-with-go-ahead mid-session; follow whichever cadence
was most recently requested rather than defaulting back silently.

### Quality check after each paper

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/health_check.py --module ingest --id {ID} --wiki-dir /Users/sribeiro/Documents/Coding/speech-generation-wiki/speech-generation-wiki-content
```

Do not trust the ingest agent's own closing summary for any of the following — always verify
the actual files independently:

- **Paper count drift.** `wiki/index.md`'s paper-count callout (4 occurrences: abstract callout,
  "Papers" section line, "Browse all N papers" link, "first report is due" line) drifts on most
  ingests, in both directions, with no reliable pattern. After every paper, independently run
  `ls wiki/papers/*.md | grep -v index.md | wc -l` and `grep -c '^| \[\[' wiki/papers/index.md`
  (these two should always match each other) and fix `index.md` directly against that number.
  This is not fixable by prompting — budget for a manual fix on every single paper.
- **Citation integrity.** Before trusting a `[[wikilink]]` the agent added to Wiki Connections,
  confirm the target actually has a wiki page (`ls wiki/papers/{id}.md`) and isn't just
  `status: accepted` or `rejected` in metadata. If it has no page yet, keep the ID in
  `related_papers` frontmatter but remove it from the linked prose (do not cite a page that
  doesn't exist). Agents' own `references.json` `in_corpus` flags are frequently stale in both
  directions — cross-check against the real `wiki/papers/` directory, not the flag.
- **Duplicate / row count.** Confirm exactly one row for the paper ID in `papers/index.md`.
- **Title truncation.** Compare the title in the new `papers/index.md` row against the page's own
  `title:` frontmatter, in full. Agents intermittently cut titles off mid-word with no reliable
  pattern. Not fixable by prompting alone; budget for a manual check on every paper. See
  [[feedback_title_truncation]].
- **Metadata status.** Confirm `status: ingested` and `ingested_date` are actually set in
  `raw/metadata/{id}.json`.
- **Bare wikilinks.** Fix every `wikilink_format` warning the health check reports — pipe to
  `[[id|Display Name]]`, don't just suppress the warning. The check's ID regex covers
  ACL-Anthology-style dotted IDs (`YYYY.venue-track.number` e.g. `2025.acl-long.313`) as well as
  numeric arXiv IDs — still worth a manual eyeball on any page with dotted-ID citations.
- **Canonical paper IDs.** Some papers have a canonical wiki ID that differs from their arXiv ID
  (e.g. F5-TTS is `2025.acl-long.313`, not the arXiv `2410.06885`) because the conference/proceedings
  ID took precedence at ingest time. Verify any citation's ID against `wiki/papers/index.md`
  before linking — don't assume the arXiv ID is right just because that's what the source paper's
  own bibliography uses. See [[feedback_f5tts_paper_id]] for the canonical example.
- **Rejected-paper citations.** Before linking to any in-corpus reference, check its `status` —
  `accepted`-but-unwritten keeps the ID in `related_papers` frontmatter with prose de-linked;
  `rejected` removes it entirely (do not link or cite by ID at all, mention unlinked in prose if
  needed). This recurs even on papers the source paper discusses substantively in its own text.

### Tagging rules to apply during ingest (not just structural QC)

These are judgment calls the ingest agent makes per paper — verify independently, don't just
trust the agent's own reasoning in its closing summary:

- **VC task tag** — requires a dedicated VC system + genuine VC-specific metrics (zero metrics of
  any kind fails the bar, even if the system nominally supports voice conversion/editing). See
  [[feedback_vc_task_tagging]].
- **`spoken-language-model` concept tag** — requires an EXTERNAL speech signal consumed by an
  adapted LLM in a real spoken-dialogue context. An autoregressive TTS-LM consuming only its own
  generated output does NOT qualify. See [[feedback_spoken_language_model_tagging]].
- **`multilingual-tts` concept tag** — legitimate if the paper's OWN system was trained/adapted
  across languages, even without full per-language metrics; spurious if it only cites an upstream
  model's claimed multilingual capability. See [[feedback_multilingual_tts_tagging]].
- **`subjective-evaluation` concept tag** — requires real human raters (MOS/listening test);
  LLM-judge/automated scoring never qualifies. See [[feedback_subjective_evaluation_tagging]].
- **Task/`related_concepts` consistency** — a task tag (e.g. `singing`) is frequently omitted from
  `related_concepts` even when explicitly warned; verify independently every ingest. See
  [[feedback_task_related_concepts_mismatch]].
- **YAML date/ID coercion** — unquoted dates parse as YAML date objects, and unquoted numeric-
  looking IDs (e.g. `1412.6980`) parse as floats, dropping trailing zeros. Quote all date fields
  and the `id` field as strings. See [[feedback_yaml_coercion_gotchas]].
- **Abstract callout.** The abstract card is ALWAYS `[!abstract]`, never the same callout type
  used in that page's own Field Significance section (`[!tip]` for high, `[!important]` for
  foundational). This recurred repeatedly across Q4 — any *elevated* `field_significance.level`
  appears to prime the mistake. Check this specifically before running the health check.

### Corpus-scope precedent chain (when a paper's generative-speech connection is unclear)

The test is **subject-matter relevance to TTS/VC/SCA** (including data/tooling/methodology work
squarely in service of speech generation), not literally "does the paper train a model." Read the
actual paper before deciding — task tags and relevance scores are not reliable signals on their
own. See [[feedback_corpus_scope_asr_false_accept]] for the full precedent chain, summarized:

- **Reject** — FAMA, MLC-SLM challenge summary: pure ASR/speech-translation/diarization papers
  whose only connection to "generative" is surface-level terminology ("speech LLM") in the title.
- **Accept** — 2506.04077 (TTS-as-data-augmentation): TTS is not the primary contribution, but the
  paper genuinely and methodologically engages with a TTS system (real claims about its behavior).
- **Accept (scope exception)** — 2510.03111 (TTS preprocessing pipelines): no TTS model trained or
  evaluated, but the paper's entire subject matter IS TTS data curation — it's a different axis
  from FAMA/MLC-SLM entirely, not an exception to that rule.
- **Accept (precedent reapplied)** — AURA, then VoiceAgentBench (2510.07978): agentic tool-use
  benchmarks where TTS/VC is incidental to the voice interface and never evaluated as output.
  Accepted for consistency once the shape was already decided once — when a new paper matches an
  already-decided precedent this closely, surface the match explicitly rather than re-deciding
  the underlying scope question fresh each time.
- **Accept (one-off override, not a precedent)** — 2510.09424 (Spoken Dialog State Tracking):
  zero TTS/VC/synthesized-speech output, structurally a FAMA/MLC-SLM match, but the user overrode
  explicitly as a one-off. A second same-shape paper (2511.22503) was evaluated fresh afterward
  and rejected — do not treat this override as license to wave through future DST papers.
- **Accept (new precedent shape — analysis-of-existing-speech)** — 2512.16832 (prosody/text
  information-theoretic analysis): no TTS/VC/SCA system built or evaluated, purely a linguistics
  analysis paper, but accepted as directly useful background for prosody-control/expressive-TTS
  research. A genuinely new shape distinct from 2510.03111 (tooling-for-building-speech) — this is
  analysis-of-existing-speech instead. Extended once more by 2512.21706 (full-duplex
  conversational-behavior-reasoning), which is closer to this shape than a genuine generation
  paper despite constructing a real audio training corpus and benchmarking real speech-generation
  systems. Each of these is judged and accepted fresh as its own case, not auto-approved — see
  [[future_dst_scope_expansion]] for the standing P2 backlog item to eventually widen the
  controlled vocabulary so these stop needing one-off calls.

### arXiv full-version / extended-paper dedup

Some papers get a later arXiv "full version" under a completely different, unrelated-looking ID
(e.g. `2501.15907` was the full version of the already-ingested `2407.05361` Emilia paper). Check
`arxiv_comment` for "full version of X" / "extended version" / "journal version" language whenever
a candidate's arXiv ID prefix doesn't match its `published_date` — this is a stronger and cheaper
signal than assuming it's just the routine chronological-ordering gotcha below. If found and the
referenced ID is already ingested, surface it to the user rather than deciding unilaterally; the
resolution isn't always the same (compare to the plain French/English duplicate case, which was a
straightforward reject-the-non-canonical-version). See [[feedback_arxiv_full_version_dedup]] for
the full resolution procedure (keep canonical ID, re-ingest its content from the fuller paper,
backfill `source_ids`, add an editorial note on the page, log as `misc` not `ingest`).

Also check the INGEST_RESULT signal for `review_flags`; if present, add the paper to the
**Manual Verification Queue** below and resolve by hand after the batch — don't block the next
paper on it (see [[project_review_flags]] for the precision-gate rule agents apply before
flagging). Note: agents sometimes omit the `INGEST_RESULT` signal entirely, especially on a retry
after an interruption — this is not itself an error, just verify the files directly. Also don't
trust an agent's closing summary in general — it sometimes narrates a correct decision while the
actual file contradicts it; always re-read the real file (see [[feedback_agent_selfreport_unreliable]]).

### arXiv ID prefix vs. published date

Some papers carry a misleading arXiv ID prefix (e.g. a `2601.xxxxx` ID for a paper actually
published in December). Always trust `published_date` in `raw/metadata/{id}.json` for
chronological ordering and quarter assignment, not the ID prefix.

### Interruption recovery (session limits, API errors)

If an agent is cut off mid-ingest (session limit, API 5xx, etc.), before retrying: check the
**standalone content repo** (never `infra/wiki/` — that's a submodule pointer and can be stale,
giving a false "nothing written" signal) for whether the page file, index row, or metadata
status actually got written. A clean "nothing written" state is safe to retry directly. A
partial-write state (e.g. a stray copied figure asset with no page yet, or a page written but
index/log/metadata not yet updated) needs the retry to verify and complete or reuse what's there
rather than assuming either way. See [[feedback_session_limit_interruption]] for the full
two-case recovery pattern.

Two other long-standing corpus-wide QC bugs to keep verifying manually regardless of whether a
given session's batches stay clean: `wiki/index.md`/venue-page count fabrication (see
[[feedback_index_count_drift]]) and mid-string title truncation in `papers/index.md` rows (see
[[feedback_title_truncation]]) — both are "not fixable by prompting."

### Known open vocabulary gap

No canonical vocabulary term currently covers non-text-input speech generation (brain-signal
decoding, lip-to-speech, audio-continuation-only systems). Several Q3/Q4 papers were tagged `TTS`
as the closest fit pending a user decision on whether to add a dedicated term. If this recurs in
Q1 2026, tag `TTS` as the same fallback and flag it in the Manual Verification Queue rather than
inventing a new term unilaterally.

## Session Log

(No sessions yet — this section will hold per-batch narrative entries once Q1 2026 ingestion starts.)

---

## Manual Verification Queue

Papers where the ingest agent emitted `review_flags` in its INGEST_RESULT signal. Review these
after the session batch is complete — check the paper page and resolve each flag by hand.

| Paper ID | Flag | Agent note |
|----------|------|------------|
| _(none yet)_ | | |

## Progress

Track with the same script as in the Scope section above (repeated here for convenience):

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 -c "
import json, glob
accepted, ingested, rejected = 0, 0, 0
for path in glob.glob('raw/metadata/*.json'):
    m = json.load(open(path))
    y, mo = str(m.get('year','')), str(m.get('month','0')).zfill(2)
    if y == '2026' and mo in ('01','02','03'):
        if m['status'] == 'accepted': accepted += 1
        if m['status'] == 'ingested': ingested += 1
        if m['status'] == 'rejected': rejected += 1
print(f'Ingested: {ingested} | Remaining: {accepted} | Rejected: {rejected}')
"
```

## Commit / Push Workflow

Not every batch needs a commit — batch within a session freely, commit at natural stopping
points or when explicitly asked. When committing:

1. Content repo: stage new paper pages + assets + `index.md`/`log.md`/`papers/index.md`, commit, push.
2. Infra repo: stage `raw/metadata/*.json` status updates + this session log (and `BACKLOG.md` if
   its Q1 progress line has gone stale), commit; then bump the `wiki/` submodule pointer to the
   new content commit (checkout `main` in `wiki/`, `git pull`, commit the pointer bump in infra), push.
3. Site repo: bump the `content` submodule pointer, commit, push — **ask before this step**
   (though a durable standing instruction to always bump satisfies this too — check for one
   before asking), it triggers a live deploy. Push order is always content → infra → site, since
   site's submodule reference only resolves once content is on GitHub.

Parallel-worktree note: if ingest and integrate/render streams are running concurrently (see
[[project_parallel_worktrees]]), check `git log HEAD..origin/main` and `git status` on the trunk
checkout before merging `work/ingest` into `main` — another stream may have already landed
unpushed commits directly on `main`. Expect a single mechanical `log.md` conflict if both streams
appended to the same date section; resolve by keeping both entry blocks. After merging and
pushing, fast-forward the `work/ingest` worktree branch back to `main` in both repos.

---

Always edit and commit from the **standalone content repo**
(`/Users/sribeiro/Documents/Coding/speech-generation-wiki/speech-generation-wiki-content`), never
via `infra/wiki/` or `site/content/` submodule paths directly — both are detached-HEAD checkouts
of specific commits, and committing there orphans the work. See [[project_repo_structure]] for
the three-repo layout and [[feedback_site_submodule_bump]] for the submodule-bump specifics
(use `git branch` not `git submodule status` to verify branch state). Commit messages: no
`Co-Authored-By` trailers, no session-number prefix — describe what changed, not when (see
[[feedback_commit_messages]]). Wiki prose: avoid em dashes, use comma/colon/parentheses instead
(see [[feedback_em_dashes]]).
